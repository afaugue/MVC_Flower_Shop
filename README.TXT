Final Project Database: Flower Shop


PURPOSE: 

For this program the database contains the inventory 
for a simple flower shop. In it the user can update the current inventory 
of items in stock and make additional changes such as adding and subtracting 
from the current stock. The program will show a list of items and beside the 
name will be the current number of the stock. There the user can change the 
number using the plus or minus button, this button will automatically
 update the database.



HOW TO USE:

Run the MVCFlowerShop.jar file.

CHANGE LOG:
V1:
Added a new layout main frame uses the box layout while the internal paneles uses the 
border layout.

V2:
Added the ability to change the value dynamically, so you do not have to use the plus
or minus button. Just change the value then press the enter button.

Added the ability to add a flower to the list just click on the edit menu. 
The program will prompt you to enter the flower name, then for the flower quantity.
